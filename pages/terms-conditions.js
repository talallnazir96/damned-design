          You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
          relating to the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
          validity of these Terms or the use of the website and purchase of the

        <p>
          In the event a dispute arises in connection with the products offered
          through the website or the breach of these terms and conditions, the
          parties agree to submit their dispute to arbitration resolution before
          a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed by the parties

          communication through our contact information. Damned Designs may
          choose to send you a written offer after receiving your initial
          communication. If we offer and send you a settlement offer and you do
          not accept the offer, or we are unable to resolve your dispute
          satisfactorily and you wish to continue with the dispute process, you
          must initiate the dispute resolution process before an accredited
          arbitration organization and file a separate Demand for Arbitration.
